# SQL-Portfolio-Project
Customer churn is a critical business metric, especially in sectors like telecommunications, where maintaining a strong subscriber base is key to success. High churn rates—where customers leave a service—can signal significant issues, from poor customer experience to competition-driven factors. This blog explores a SQL-based analysis of customer churn using a dataset from IBM’s fictional telecom company, detailing insights and techniques to address customer retention challenges.

## Overview of the SQL Portfolio Project
This project revolves around analyzing a fictional telco dataset containing information about 7,043 customers. The dataset, sourced from GitHub, represents a telecom company in California offering both home phone and internet services. The aim is to perform an in-depth analysis of customer churn using SQL queries to answer key business questions and offer solutions for improving customer retention.

### The Importance of Churn Analysis
Customer churn has major implications for a telecom business, both in terms of lost revenue and the high costs associated with acquiring new customers. Churn analysis helps identify patterns, behaviors, and factors contributing to customer exits. Insights from such analysis can help telecom companies tailor their marketing strategies, optimize customer experiences, and ultimately reduce churn. Common churn causes, such as billing issues, network problems, or poor customer service, can be addressed to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

#### Dataset and Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
The analysis began with data cleaning using Excel to ensure the dataset was ready for SQL queries. The ERD created in MIRO illustrates the key relationships between different entities in the dataset, including customers, services, contracts, and payment methods. This diagram is essential for understanding how different aspects of the business impact customer churn.

##### Tools and Resources
For the technical aspect of the project, the dataset was cleaned using Excel before being imported into MySQL Workbench for querying. Excel’s INDEX and MATCH functions were instrumental in joining tables and removing unnecessary columns. For those interested in exploring the dataset and SQL queries, resources such as the cleaned dataset, ERD, and SQL queries are available on Google Drive and GitHub.

###### Conclusion
Analyzing customer churn is crucial for telecom companies to stay competitive in today’s fast-paced market. Through SQL queries, this project revealed actionable insights that can help telco companies enhance customer satisfaction, reduce churn rates, and increase profitability. By focusing on high-churn groups, improving service areas that receive negative feedback, and optimizing payment methods, telecom companies can improve their retention strategies.
